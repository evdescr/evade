- **Auto Revive Teammates** ❤️  
  **Evade script auto revive** scans nearby downed players and instantly revives them when safe. Includes delay randomization to look more human-like and reduce detection chance.

  Adjustable speed multiplier (1.5x — 4x) that works while running and jumping. Combine with auto-jump for insane movement.

- **ESP Wallhack** 👀  
  Player, seeker, and candy ESP with distance indicators and health bars. Color-coded danger levels help you plan escapes.

  Hold space to fly through the air — great for reaching impossible spots and escaping seekers.

  Temporary phase through selected walls (toggleable) — perfect for emergency escapes.

  Pulls nearby candies directly to you without moving — super useful in end-game circles.

- **Anti-AFK System** 😴
